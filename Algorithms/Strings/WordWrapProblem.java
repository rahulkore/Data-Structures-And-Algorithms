 * Given a sequence of words, and a limit on the number of characters that can be put in one line
 *  (line width). Put line breaks in the given sequence such that the lines are printed neatly. 
 * Assume that the length of each word is smaller than the line width.
The word processors like MS Word do task of placing line breaks. The idea is to have balanced lines. 
In other words, not have few lines with lots of extra spaces and some lines with small amount of 
extra spaces. 
 

The extra spaces includes spaces put at the end of every line except the last one.  
The problem is to minimize the following total cost.
 Cost of a line = (Number of extra spaces in the line)^3
 Total Cost = Sum of costs for all lines

For example, consider the following string and line width M = 15
 "Geeks for Geeks presents word wrap problem" 
     
Following is the optimized arrangement of words in 3 lines
Geeks for Geeks
presents word
wrap problem 

The total extra spaces in line 1, line 2 and line 3 are 0, 2 and 3 respectively. 
So optimal value of total cost is 0 + 2*2 + 3*3 = 13
Please note that the total cost function is not sum of extra spaces, but sum of cubes (or square is 
also used) of extra spaces. The idea behind this cost function is to balance the spaces among lines.
 For example, consider the following two arrangement of same set of words:
1) There are 3 lines. One line has 3 extra spaces and all other lines have 0 extra spaces. Total extra
 spaces = 3 + 0 + 0 = 3. Total cost = 3*3*3 + 0*0*0 + 0*0*0 = 27.
2) There are 3 lines. Each of the 3 lines has one extra space. Total extra spaces = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
. Total cost = 1*1*1 + 1*1*1 + 1*1*1 = 3.
Total extra spaces are 3 in both scenarios, but second arrangement should be preferred because extra
 spaces are balanced in all three lines. The cost function with cubic sum serves the purpose because
  the value of total cost in second scenario is less.

  Given an array nums[] of size n, where nums[i] denotes the number of characters in one word. Let K be the limit on the number of characters that can be put in one line (line width). Put line breaks in the given sequence such that the lines are printed neatly.
Assume that the length of each word is smaller than the line width. When line breaks are inserted there is a possibility that extra spaces are present in each line. The extra spaces include spaces put at the end of every line except the last one. 

You have to minimize the following total cost where total cost = Sum of cost of all lines, where cost of line is = (Number of extra spaces in the line)2.

Example 1:

Input: nums = {3,2,2,5}, k = 6
Output: 10
Explanation: Given a line can have 6
characters,
Line number 1: From word no. 1 to 1
Line number 2: From word no. 2 to 3
Line number 3: From word no. 4 to 4
So total cost = (6-3)2 + (6-2-2-1)2 = 32+12 = 10.
As in the first line word length = 3 thus
extra spaces = 6 - 3 = 3 and in the second line
there are two word of length 2 and there already
1 space between two word thus extra spaces
= 6 - 2 -2 -1 = 1. As mentioned in the problem
description there will be no extra spaces in
the last line. Placing first and second word
in first line and third word on second line
would take a cost of 02 + 42 = 16 (zero spaces
on first line and 6-2 = 4 spaces on second),
which isn't the minimum possible cost.
Example 2:

Input: nums = {3,2,2}, k = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: Given a line can have 4 
characters,
Line number 1: From word no. 1 to 1
Line number 2: From word no. 2 to 2
Line number 3: From word no. 3 to 3
Same explaination as above total cost
= (4 - 3)2 + (4 - 2)2 = 5.
