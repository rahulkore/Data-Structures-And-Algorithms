/**You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60.\
 Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60

    /**t % 60 gets the remainder from 0 to 59.
We count the occurrence of each remainders in a array/hashmap c.

we want to know that, for each t,
how many x satisfy (t + x) % 60 = 0.

The straight forward idea is to take x % 60 = 60 - t % 60,
which is valid for the most cases.
But if t % 60 = 0, x % 60 = 0 instead of 60.

One solution is to use x % 60 = (60 - t % 60) % 60,
the other idea is to use x % 60 = (600 - t) % 60.
Not sure which one is more straight forward. */
