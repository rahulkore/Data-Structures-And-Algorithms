/**
 * Find maximum possible stolen value from houses
 * 
 * 
 * There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it. 
 * A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal
 *  in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbors 
 * left and right side. What is the maximum stolen value?
Examples: 
 

Input: hval[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4}
Output: 19

Explanation: The thief will steal 6, 1, 8 and 4 from the house.

Input: hval[] = {5, 3, 4, 11, 2}
Output: 16

Explanation: Thief will steal 5 and 11
