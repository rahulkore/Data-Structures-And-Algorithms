/** A string s is nice if, for every letter of the alphabet that s contains, it appears both in 
 * uppercase and lowercase. For example, "abABB" is nice because 'A' and 'a' appear, and 'B' and 
 * 'b' appear. However, "abA" is not because 'b' appears, but 'B' does not.

Given a string s, return the longest substring of s that is nice. If there are multiple, return 
the substring of the earliest occurrence. If there are none, return an empty string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "YazaAay"
Output: "aAa"
Explanation: "aAa" is a nice string because 'A/a' is the only letter of the alphabet in s, and 
both 'A' and 'a' appear.
"aAa" is the longest nice substring.
Example 2:

Input: s = "Bb"
Output: "Bb"
Explanation: "Bb" is a nice string because both 'B' and 'b' appear. The whole string is a substring.
Example 3:

Input: s = "c"
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no nice substrings. */
